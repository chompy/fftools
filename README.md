FFXIV Lua
=========

Extends Final Fantasy XIV log parsing in Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) with Lua script.


## Installation

1. Download the plugin here. Extract the ZIP. Open ACT and navigate to the plugins tab.
2. Click 'Browse...' and locate the 'FFXIV_ACT_Lua.cs' file.
3. Click 'Add/Enable Plugin.'
4. Click on the 'FFXIV Lua Scripts' tab. A list of available scripts will be on the left side. Click on a script name and then click the 'Enable' button to enable the script.


## Web Scripts

Some scripts provide a webpage view which provides additonal visual information. These web views can be used in OBS as part of your streaming overlay or can be shared with other players who can't use ACT. In order to share these web pages you will need to setup port fordwarding for TCP port `31594`. Please be aware that you will need to share your IP address to make this work.

In the future I would like to look for alternative solutions for sharing web views with other players. Some thoughts include using UPNP and offering a proxy service.
